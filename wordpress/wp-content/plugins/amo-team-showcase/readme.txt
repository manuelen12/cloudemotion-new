== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there quick start video for the plugin and documentation? =
Yes, there is.
[**Quick Start Video**]( http://amothemo.com/docs/amo-team-showcase-documentation/en/#ds-quic-start "All the essentials one need to know to use the plugin") (recorded without sound).
[**Plugin Documentation**]( http://amothemo.com/docs/amo-team-showcase-documentation/en/ "Plugin documentation, mostly for shortcodes, at the moment.").

= Scrolling in member info panel doesn't work. What to do? =
You can try to enable alternative scrolling. Go to plugin Options -> Panel (tab) and turn on the Alternative Scrolling. Best looks with centered panel.

= How to display team members in a certain order? =
At the moment, there is only one way to do this. Use [Team Member]( http://amothemo.com/docs/amo-team-showcase-documentation/en/index.html#sc-member "Link to the plugin documentation, “Team Member” shortcode section.") shortcode. The order in which you specified members’ IDs in “id” attribute of the shortcode (for example, id=”31,10,241”), will be used to display the members.

= What themes or plugins don’t work with AMO Team Showcase? =
The plugin doesn’t work with Divi theme (for example), the theme uses MagnificPopup JS too and there is a conflict. The same issue may arise with other plugins or themes, which use MagnificPopup (a js plugin/library). If you click on member thumbnail and info panel doesn't appear, that's most probably the MagnificPopup JS conflict.
